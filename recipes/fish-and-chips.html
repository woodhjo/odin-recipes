        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to 95&deg;C. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet
            and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder,
            salt, and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the beer and milk to the bowl and whisk until the batter is
            smooth and free of lumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil to
            190&deg;C.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pat the fish fillets dry with a paper towel and season them lightly
            with salt and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dip each fish fillet into the batter, making sure it's coated
            evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully place the battered fish fillets into the hot oil and fry
            for 4-5 minutes or until the batter is crispy and golden brown.
            Remove the fish from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer it to
            the wire rack on the baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the fish is frying, blanch the potato strips in boiling water
            for 3-4 minutes, then drain them and pat them dry with paper towels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the fish is done, increase the temperature of the oil to
            200&deg;C and fry the potato strips in batches until they are golden
            and crispy, about 5-7 minutes per batch. Remove the chips from the
            oil with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season the fish and chips with salt and serve immediately with your
            favourite condiments. Enjoy!
