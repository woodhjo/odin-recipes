        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat your oven to 190&deg;C. Cook the lasagna noodles according
            to the package instructions until they are al dente.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large skillet overmedium-high heat, cook the ground beef or
            turkey, onion, and garlic until the emat is no longer pink. Drain
            off any excess fat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, salt, black
            pepper, and sugar to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a simmer and
            cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the
            shredded mozarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and chopped
            parsley.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread about 1/3 of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking
            dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce,
            overlapping them slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then add another
            layer of noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat with another layer of sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture. Top
            with a final layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over
            the top of the lasagna.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the
            foil and continue baking for an additional 25 minutes or until the
            cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is heated through.
          </li>
          <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
